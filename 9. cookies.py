'''
A Request object contains a cookieâ€™s attribute. It is a dictionary object of 
all the cookie variables and their corresponding values, 
a client has transmitted. In addition to it, a cookie also 
stores its expiry time, path and domain name of the site.

In Flask, cookies are set on response object. 
Use make_response() function to get response object 
from return value of a view function. After that, use the set_cookie() 
function of response object to store a cookie.

Reading back a cookie is easy. 
The get() method of request.cookies attribute is used 
to read a cookie.
