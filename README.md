# Flask
### I had to learn flask in limited time, I followed some online guides, and, in the process, created this small repository

**The examples range from 1 to 10 and have comments explaining the important stuff happenining between the lines.**

### Flask
**Flask** is a web application framework written in Python. It is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

### web framework
Web Application Framework or simply Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enables a web application developer to write applications without having to bother about low-level details such as protocols and thread management.

### WSGI
WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications. It has widely been adopted as a standard for Python web application development.

### Werkzeug
It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.

### Jinja2
Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.

*Flask is often referred to as a micro framework. It aims to keep the core of an application simple yet extensible. Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such functionality to the application.*
